        I am a Front-End Developer that loves to learn and push my knowledge to the limits. I enjoy being around people and working along side with them, but I also love listening to music and getting to work by myself. Doing something I love is a big motive for me, I am very passionate about coding and building something new as well as getting a new feature to work. I am also a very passionate runner that loves to get out and just run to clear my head or just to get out and be outside.
