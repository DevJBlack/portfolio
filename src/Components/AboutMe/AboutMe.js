        My name is Devin Black. I am a Front-End Developer who loves to learn and push my knowledge to the limits. I enjoy being around people and working along-side them, but I also enjoy listening to music and getting my work done independently. Doing something I love is a big motive for me, I am very passionate about coding and building something new as well as optimizing an existing project. I am also an avid runner who loves to get out and run to clear my head or be outside. I'm a dude who loves the mountains.
